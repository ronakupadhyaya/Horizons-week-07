<br />
Thursday/Friday for this week will be spent creating a mobile turn based multiplayer game in React Native for iOS. This announcement includes an overall game-plan for tackling the next two days, and outlines what is required in your final product.

### what to build & judging

You should be building a full stack **multiplayer** game (we *suggest* implementing an existing card based game like Cards Against Humanity)

All teams will demo their games on Monday morning to the whole class. Winners will be determined by your votes. Your vote should be based on the following criteria:
1. What works best? (fewest bugs)
1. What is the most fun to play?
1. Which game requires the most technical work?

*note that you can not vote for your own team even though it is the best one*

**REQUIRED**: Your game **must** be multiplayer & **must** include a backend hosted on heroku or gomix.

### schedule/game-plan
1. you will be placed into groups of three or four
1. brainstorm & decide on what to build
1. draw up a proposal w/
  - MongoDB models and fields (i.e. schema design)
  - team work assignments (how will work be distributed amongst team members)

  - components you will use to build your app *[OPTIONAL]*
1. **PROPOSALS DUE THURSDAY @11:00 a.m. SHARP** -- *work on them Wednesday night/Thursday morning*
  - we will review proposals and make sure they:
    - meet requirements
    - are practical
