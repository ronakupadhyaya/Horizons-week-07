# Pair programming exercise: Ho! Ho! Ho! (Part Deux)

## Goal

Your goal is to extend the [Ho! Ho! Ho! project](../day1/hohoho)
to add a final set of features:

- After the user logs in, always check for new messages and update the display
  when new ones arrive
- Display photos included in your messages
- Ability to send photos along with your messages

## Instructions

The instructions for these exercises are short and sweet to give you a chance
to practice looking through documentation.

### Exercise 1. Always check new messages

Use `setInterval` in your `Messages` component to periodically make `fetch`
requests to the appropriate endpoint and show messages.

When new messages show up in the response, display them on the screen with a
yellow background to draw the user's attention.

### Exercise 2. Display photos stored in your messages

Message objects in the `GET /messages` response now include an **optional** URL for
a photo under the `photo` key. If a message has an attached photo, display it below the map using
[Images in React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html).

You can test this functionality by uploading photos using Postman.
You'll need to make a `POST` request to `https://hohoho-backend.herokuapp.com/messages`
using `form-data` for the body and an image file included as the `photo` parameter.
Don't forget to first log in while using Postman.

### Exercise 3. Upload photos on long press

Update your `longPress` handler in the `Users` component to get prompt the user
to pick an image from their camera roll. When the user picks an image upload
it along with the message under the `photo` parameter.

‚ö†Ô∏è When uploading files with `fetch()` set the `Content-Type` header
to `multipart/form-data`. ‚ö†Ô∏è
