Nihar's Express review 

1. Four most common request methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE 

Requests have a header (which must include a method)

URL's have: 
1. Path
2. Parameters
3. Queries 
    ?key=value&key2=value2&key3=value3

Order matters! Put middleware (app.use('/PATH')) comes before any other methods using that path. 
next() is needed in a middleware to keep moving down the chain of routes.
