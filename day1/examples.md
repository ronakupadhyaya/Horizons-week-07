# React Native Self Directed Examples

- **All videos have the password `horizonites`**
- Before you jump in
- Keep [lesson slides](http://lessons.horizonsbootcamp.com/week07/day1.html)
  open in your browser. Lesson slides contain code samples and links to
  essential documentation.
- You can write all your solutions in the same project. You don't need to
  create a new React Native project for each section.
- Ask for help early and often! ðŸ™‹
