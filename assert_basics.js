//assert - check if two things are equal

const assert = require('assert'); //same as npm install
  // run node assert_basics.js
//assert.equal(actual, expected, message)
// what you are checking is FIRST, what you are testing against, message
assert.equal(1 + 1 + 1, 2, "They are not equal");


//EQUAL VS DEEP EQUAL (compares objects)
