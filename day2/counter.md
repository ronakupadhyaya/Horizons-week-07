# Inline exercise: React Native counter
## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Goal

The goal is to refresh our knowledge of React state by rebuilding the
[simple counter app](https://github.com/horizons-school-of-technology/week06/blob/master/day3/warmup.md)
that we built last week using React Native.

## Instructions

1. Open [Inline Exercise 3 in RNPlay](https://rnplay.org/apps/YIt_Bg)
1. Add code to the `plus()` handler of `SampleApp` to increment the counter
   by one using `this.setState()`
1. Create a new button (i.e. `<TouchableOpacity>`) for `Minus` that
   decrements the counter by 1 when clicked.
1. If you finish early, add the ability to reset the counter back to zero
   by clicking on the number itself.
